How to get the code working on your computer:

== GITHUB ==

FORKING A PROJECT (copying to your own device):

1. Create fork clicking button (on github.com/project-you-want-to-fork)
2. in your terminal, navigate to where you want the folder to be created
   
   git clone <url-from-the-fork-not-from-the-original> 

(connection to local machine from fork is then called "origin")

3. cd into that folder /cravecrafter (you could also restart vscode just with that folder just in case)
4. open it up into vscode (" code . " )
5. start venv:
    python3 -m venv my_venv
        note ^ if python3 doesn't work, try python. I need python3 since I use a Mac 
    . my_venv/bin/activate 
6. install dependencies:
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
        note ^ if pip3 doesn't work, use pip 
7. *make edits*
then UPDATING LIFECYCLE to get to commit, regular terminal COMMANDS (use origin)

    1. git add . (. means all, could just upload one file, would put <filename>)
    2. git commit -m "my message goes here" (first message is usually "first commit")
    3. git push <remote_name> <branch> (git push origin master/main) * we want to use origin / main
                origin         main
    4. IDONG: make sure pull request has been completed on github

BASIC PROCESS:

IDONG:
    ADDING A FILE: 
    1. git add .
    2. git commit -m "<message>"
    3. git push origin main
    4. make sure pull request is done on IDONG's github

    PULLING FROM GITHUB AFTER AN UPDATE HAS BEEN MADE:
    git pull upstream main

    ***dont forget to sync fork, on github***


SIMON:
    ADDING A FILE: 
    1. git add .
    2. git commit -m "<message>"
    3. git push origin main

    PULLING FROM GITHUB AFTER AN UPDATE HAS BEEN MADE:
    git pull origin main
